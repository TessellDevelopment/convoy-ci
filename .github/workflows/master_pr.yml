  # This code in not serving any purpose now other than being a false positive since always() has been added in both check-commits and auto-merge
    # 1. When DC PR is opened (Have single commit) even if dev-check or build fails since check-commits have always() it'll run and trigger auto merge
    # 2. WHen DC PR has multiple commits even if check-commits fails since auto-merge has always() it'll still trigger auto-merge when though multiple commits are present
    # 3. So everything needs to handled by having build and check-approval as required so even if auto-merge is enabled it's not merged without those passing
    # 4. Always is needed to merge DC in case of no build repos
